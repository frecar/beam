# Gemini CLI Instructions

## Context and Standards
- **Always refer to [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md)** for project context, build commands, and coding standards.
- Use `make check` or `make ci` to verify changes before completing a task.
- Mimic the style and structure of existing code in `crates/` (Rust) and `web/` (TypeScript).

## Maintenance
- **Update [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md)** whenever you identify new project conventions, significant architectural changes, or updated build/test procedures.
- Ensure both `GEMINI.md` and `CLAUDE.md` stay in sync as the primary guides for AI interaction with this repository.
